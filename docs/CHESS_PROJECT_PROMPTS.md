# Chess Project - Development Prompts & Requirements

## Project Overview
A sophisticated browser-based Chess game built with Spring Boot, featuring multiple AI opponents with advanced machine learning capabilities including AlphaZero, Leela Chess Zero, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and classical chess engines.

## Key Development Prompts & Requirements

### 1. Log Level Optimization
**Requirement**: Reduce console output during normal gameplay while preserving important information
**Implementation**:
- Convert verbose AI processing logs from INFO to DEBUG level
- Keep board state display at INFO level for visual representation
- Remove unnecessary WebSocket endpoint logging statements

### 2. Board Display Enhancement
**Requirement**: Ensure visual board representation appears in normal logs
**Implementation**:
- Modified `printBoardState()` method from DEBUG to INFO level
- Maintain visual chess board output for debugging and monitoring

### 3. AI Capture Logic Enhancement
**Requirement**: Improve move evaluation to prioritize high-value piece captures
**Implementation**:
- Enhanced scoring system to prioritize Knights over Pawns
- Added tactical sacrifice logic
- Improved `evaluateMoveQuality()` method for better move comparison

### 4. Queen Protection Logic
**Requirement**: Prevent tactical blunders where pieces pinned to the Queen expose it to attack
**Implementation**:
- Added comprehensive Queen pinning detection
- Implemented `isPiecePinned()` and `isPiecePinnedToQueen()` methods
- Enhanced `findPieceProtectionMove()` for defensive logic

### 5. AlphaZero Human Game Learning
**Requirement**: Process human games for AlphaZero training with proper reward signals
**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `addHumanGameData()` method in AlphaZeroAI.java
- Convert game outcomes to reward signals (+1.0 for white win, -1.0 for black win)
- Process each move with perspective-adjusted rewards
- Periodic neural network saving after substantial games

### 6. Chess Piece Value Correction
**Requirement**: Fix piece values to match standard chess evaluation
**Implementation**:
- Corrected `getChessPieceValue()` method with standard values:
  - Pawn = 100
  - Bishop = 300
  - Knight = 320 (more valuable than Bishop)
  - Rook = 500
  - Queen = 900
  - King = 10000

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### Core Components
- **ChessGame.java**: Main game engine (4,360 lines) with 10 AI systems
- **AI Systems**: 10 different AI implementations running in parallel
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time communication with rate limiting
- **GPU Acceleration**: OpenCL/CUDA support for neural networks
- **Opening Book**: Professional Leela Chess Zero database with 100+ openings

### AI Systems Integration
1. **AlphaZero AI**: Self-play neural network with MCTS
2. **Leela Chess Zero AI**: Human game knowledge with transformer architecture
3. **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Classical MCTS with tree reuse
4. **Negamax AI**: Classical chess engine with alpha-beta pruning
5. **Q-Learning AI**: Reinforcement learning with experience replay
6. **Deep Learning AI**: Neural network position evaluation
7. **CNN Deep Learning AI**: Convolutional neural network for spatial patterns
8. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Deep reinforcement learning
9. **Genetic Algorithm AI**: Evolutionary learning
10. **OpenAI Chess AI**: GPT-4 powered chess analysis

### Performance Requirements
- **Parallel Execution**: All enabled AIs run simultaneously for move selection
- **Thread Safety**: Race condition protection for AI initialization
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient tensor operations and model loading
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle AI system failures and timeouts

## Key Development Insights

### Technical Insights
- Different AI systems use fundamentally different evaluation methods but are compared using unified `evaluateMoveQuality()` scoring system
- AI training does not need restart when evaluation logic changes - improvements apply immediately during move comparison
- Queen pinning logic works at game engine level, benefiting all AIs automatically without retraining
- Standard chess piece values have Knight (320) slightly more valuable than Bishop (300)

### Implementation Patterns
- **SOLID Principles**: Dependency injection for AlphaZero components
- **Factory Pattern**: AlphaZero component creation
- **Observer Pattern**: WebSocket real-time updates
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple AI implementations with common interface
