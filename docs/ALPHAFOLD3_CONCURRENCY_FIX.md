# AlphaFold3AI Concurrency Correctness Fix

## Issue
AlphaFold3AI was mutating `positionEvaluations` and `learnedTrajectories` from multiple threads without proper synchronization, causing potential race conditions and data corruption during serialization.

## Root Cause
1. **Concurrent Access**: Training thread and move selection thread both accessed shared state
2. **Serialization Race**: `saveState()` could serialize while maps were being modified
3. **Inconsistent Types**: Declared as `ConcurrentHashMap` but loaded as regular `HashMap`

## Solution

### 1. Consistent ConcurrentHashMap Usage
```java
// Before: Mixed types
private final Map<String, Double> positionEvaluations = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
positionEvaluations = (Map<String, Double>) ois.readObject(); // HashMap

// After: Consistent ConcurrentHashMap
private final ConcurrentHashMap<String, Double> positionEvaluations = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
if (loadedPositions != null) positionEvaluations.putAll(loadedPositions);
```

### 2. Snapshot-Based Serialization
```java
// Before: Direct serialization (race condition)
oos.writeObject(positionEvaluations);
oos.writeObject(learnedTrajectories);

// After: Snapshot protection
oos.writeObject(new HashMap<>(positionEvaluations));
oos.writeObject(new HashMap<>(learnedTrajectories));
```

### 3. Thread-Safe Loading
```java
// Before: Direct assignment (not thread-safe)
positionEvaluations = (Map<String, Double>) ois.readObject();

// After: Thread-safe population
Map<String, Double> loadedPositions = (Map<String, Double>) ois.readObject();
if (loadedPositions != null) positionEvaluations.putAll(loadedPositions);
```

## Key Changes

### AlphaFold3AI.java
- **Import**: Added `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`
- **Fields**: Changed to explicit `ConcurrentHashMap` types
- **saveState()**: Create snapshots before serialization (both async and sync paths)
- **loadState()**: Use `putAll()` instead of direct assignment
- **Exception Handling**: Use `clear()` instead of reassignment

## Benefits
1. **Thread Safety**: Eliminates race conditions between training and move selection
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents corruption during concurrent access
3. **Serialization Safety**: Snapshots prevent `ConcurrentModificationException`
4. **Consistency**: Uniform ConcurrentHashMap usage throughout

## Testing
- Verified concurrent training and move selection work without exceptions
- Confirmed state persistence works correctly under concurrent load
- Validated no data loss during rapid save/load cycles

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: Snapshot creation only during saves (infrequent operation)
- **Memory**: Temporary snapshot overhead during serialization
- **Concurrency**: Better performance due to reduced lock contention
